# qtd - quetting things done
## Introduction
qtd is a [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) personal workflow management software supporting the user in the "Getting Things Done" process.
Mainly, it is a TODO-list where tasks in the list can be connected via dependencies and categorized with tags. Start and due dates can be set to further control the workflow.

The app is designed with privacy in mind; it runs on your device instead of a server and per default, all data is stored only locally. Yet, data is stored in a single file and can be easily distributed. 

qtd is based on the Qt framework but is in no other way related to Qt. It is inspired by [Getting things GNOME!](https://getting-things-gnome.github.io/) (GTG) but aims to provide a slightly different set of features at a later point.
If you find qtd is not the right choice for you, make sure to also check out GTG!

## What qtd is not
While synchronisation and multi-platform support is planned for the future, qtd is not meant to scale well for teams. It is intended for personal use or use with only very few people. 

## Current State
This piece of software is currently in development stage; some things may work but it is not ready for production. Hence, no executables are provided for the time being and there won't be any migration scripts to transfer data to a future stable version.
